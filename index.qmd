## Experience

<i class="bi bi-asterisk"></i> **Federal University of Minas Gerais, BR (DCC/UFMG) | Associate Professor of Computer Science |  2019 - present**


The deparment of Computer Science of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais is a top-class Computer Science department that runs one of the most traditional graduate program in Brazil. It was evaluated with level 7 (which is the highest) by CAPES (the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education). I have been teaching classes such as Computer Networks, introduction to programming, and Urban Computing in graduate and undergraduate level.

<i class="bi bi-asterisk"></i> **Federal University of Alagoas, BR (UFAL) | Associate Professor of Computer Science |  2012 - 2019**

I taught classes on Data Analysis, Computer Networks, Statistics, Discrete Mathematics and Analysis of Algorithms, in graduate and undergraduate levels. I advised 7 graduate students and 16 undergrad projects. I was the dean of the graduate program of Computing Modeling for 1 year and the vice-president of the Computing Institute (IC/UFAL) for 1 year. I was involved in the approval of US$ 600K in projects funded by research agencies in Brazil.

<i class="bi bi-asterisk"></i> **Paradise Laboratory - Ottawa University, CA | Ph.D Intern | 2010 - 2011**

I worked on subjects related to how to improve the communication of vehicular networks. The results of this work were published in 3 International conferences (IEEE ICC'12, ACM PE-WASUN'11, IEEE ICNC'12,  and 1 periodical (IEEE Wireless Communication Magazine).

<i class="bi bi-asterisk"></i> **Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA | Ph.D Intern | 2010 - 2010**

LEAP: A Low Energy Assisted GPS for trajectory-based Services: 
In this project, we take a deep look at the principle and processing stages of GPS receivers and propose a new operation mode for mobile GPS sensing, called Low Energy Assisted Positioning (LEAP). LEAP showed to be a suitable solution for very low-energy GPS with block-level accuracy. The results of this project were published in 2 conferences (ACM Sensys'12 and ACM Ubicomp'11), a journal (IEEE Trans. on Mobile Computing), and a patent registered at USPTO, and received the best paper award of Sensys'12 conference.
